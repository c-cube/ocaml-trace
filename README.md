# Trace

This small library provides basic types that can be used to instrument
a library or application, either by hand or via a ppx.

Backends, using concrete tracing or observability formats such as:
- Fuchsia (see [tracing](https://github.com/janestreet/tracing))
- Catapult (see [ocaml-catapult](https://github.com/imandra-ai/catapult))
- Tracy (see [ocaml-tracy](https://github.com/imandra-ai/ocaml-tracy))
